NAME
    "Device::Chip::TMP102" - chip driver for an TMP102

SYNOPSIS
     use Device::Chip::TMP102;

     my $chip = Device::Chip::TMP102->new;
     $chip->mount( Device::Chip::Adapter::...->new )->get;

     printf "Temperature is %2.2f C\n", $chip->read_temp->get;

DESCRIPTION
    This Device::Chip subclass provides specific communication to a Texas
    Instruments TMP102 attached to a computer via an IÂ²C adapter.

    Only a subset of the chip's capabilities are currently accessible
    through this driver.

    The reader is presumed to be familiar with the general operation of this
    chip; the documentation here will not attempt to explain or define
    chip-specific concepts or features, only the use of this module to
    access them.

MOUNT PARAMETERS
  addr
    The IÂ²C address of the device. Can be specified in decimal, octal or hex
    with leading 0 or "0x" prefixes.

METHODS
    The following methods documented with a trailing call to "->get" return
    Future instances.

  read_temp
       $duty = $chip->read_temp->get

    Returns the temperature in degrees Celsius.
